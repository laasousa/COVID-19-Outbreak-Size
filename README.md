# COVID-19-Outbreak-Size
These codes outline a simple Bayesian model designed to estimate the outbreak size during the exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic from one or two surveillance streams providing counts of cases meeting various criteria. We illustrate it through scenarios based upon virological surveillance from a network of influenza-like illness consultations in primary care and from pneumonia cases in hospitals, but the approach generalizes to other surveillance streams such as mortalities.
